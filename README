Different notions of distance between two masked (presumably face) images, with implementations.

Currently implemented:
1) Rectangle MSE distance:
  1) Find the minimum bounding rectangle of each masked image.
  2) Warp one rectangle into the other.
  3) Texture error: Corresponding pixels in the foreground of each mask contribute an error proportional to squared pixel distance.
  4) Shape error: Pixels in one foreground but not in the other contribute a fixed mask mismatch error.
  5) Error is normalized by rectangle size.
